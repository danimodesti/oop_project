# oop_project
Repository for the object-oriented programming final project, in which we'll make a simple game, similar to "Guess Who?" (the brazilian version is "Cara a cara"). The player will have to guess the movie instead of 'faces of people', based on simple hints.


Necessary Python modules for running the application: 
- PySimpleGUI
- pandas
- PIL
- re
- time
- cv2
- webbrowser
- tkinter
- select
- email.mime
- ctypes
- csv
- glob
- os
- math
- random
- textwrap

The above control the graphic interface, the movie's sorting operations, the percentage of penalty's lost score, .csv files' manipulation and time-control for timed game-mode.
